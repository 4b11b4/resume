- impact for "git submodules"
- quantify "kicad api, open-source tools"
- maybe less bullet points if there is more impact and quantification (specifically in Cinder and Folktek)
- take out hardware experience
- if you can't talk about it, it shouldn't be on your resume
- technical SKILLS rather than STRENGTHS?
  - or remove Verilog, ASM, C++?
